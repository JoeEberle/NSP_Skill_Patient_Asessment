## patient assessment

Here's a summary of performing a patient assessment, following the outlined steps:

### 1. Scene Size-Up
- **Ensure Scene Safety**: Verify the area is safe for you, the patient, and others.
- **Introduction and Consent**: Introduce yourself and obtain the patient's permission to provide care.
- **Determine Mechanism of Injury or Nature of Illness**: Understand what caused the patient’s condition or injury.
- **Standard Precautions**: Use protective measures (e.g., gloves, masks) to prevent infection.
- **Assess Number of Patients**: Identify if there is more than one patient.
- **Additional Resources**: Determine if additional help or equipment (e.g., backboard, extraction tools) is needed.

### 2. Primary Assessment
- **General Impression**: Quickly evaluate the patient's overall condition.
- **Control Life-Threatening Bleeding**: Immediately address severe bleeding.
- **Assess Level of Responsiveness (LOR)**: Check how responsive the patient is.
- **Rapid ABCD Assessment**: Assess Airway, Breathing, Circulation, and Disability (level of consciousness, mobility).
- **Obtain Chief Complaint**: Identify the primary issue or symptom reported by the patient.
- **Update Dispatch**: Communicate with dispatch about the patient's condition and any additional needs.

### 3. Obtain Patient History
- **SAMPLE History**: Collect information on:
  - **S**igns & Symptoms
  - **A**llergies
  - **M**edications
  - **P**ast medical history
  - **L**ast oral intake
  - **E**vents leading up to the situation
- **OPQRST (if applicable)**: For pain assessment:
  - **O**nset
  - **P**rovocation/Palliation
  - **Q**uality
  - **R**adiation
  - **S**everity
  - **T**ime

### 4. Secondary Assessment
- **Physical Exam**: Perform a detailed examination based on the chief complaint and initial findings.
- **Assess Vital Signs**: Check pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and other relevant vitals.

### 5. Reassessment
- **Evaluate Treatment Effectiveness**: Confirm that any provided care is working.
- **Repeat Primary Assessment**: Recheck ABCDs and LOR.
- **Reassess Vital Signs**: Monitor for any changes in the patient's condition.
- **Adjust Treatment**: Modify care based on any changes observed.
- **Prepare for Handoff**: Get ready to transfer care to a higher level, providing a detailed report.

This process ensures a systematic approach to patient assessment, addressing immediate needs while gathering critical information for ongoing care.



## RAPID ABCD assessment

Here is a brief explanation of each element in the RAPID ABCD assessment, which is used for quickly evaluating a patient's immediate needs:

- **A - Airway**:
  - Check if the patient's airway is clear and open. Ensure there are no obstructions (e.g., choking, swelling) that could hinder breathing.

- **B - Breathing**:
  - Assess the patient's breathing rate, depth, and effort. Look for signs of respiratory distress, such as shortness of breath, rapid or shallow breathing, and abnormal sounds (e.g., wheezing, gurgling).

- **C - Circulation**:
  - Evaluate the patient’s pulse, skin color, temperature, and any signs of bleeding. Look for indications of good or poor blood circulation, such as a strong, regular pulse versus weak or irregular, and pale or clammy skin.

- **D - Disability**:
  - Quickly assess the patient’s level of consciousness and neurological function. Check for any signs of neurological impairment (e.g., altered mental status, inability to move parts of the body) and evaluate responsiveness using AVPU:
    - **A**lert
    - **V**erbal response
    - **P**ain response
    - **U**nresponsive

This assessment helps identify and prioritize life-threatening conditions that require immediate intervention.





## SAMPLE - S.A.M.P.L.E 

Here's a brief explanation of each element in the SAMPLE acronym, which is used to gather essential patient history during an assessment:

- **S - Signs & Symptoms**: 
  - **Signs** are observable physical indications (e.g., swelling, rash).
  - **Symptoms** are what the patient reports feeling (e.g., pain, nausea).

- **A - Allergies**: 
  - Ask if the patient has any known allergies, including to medications, food, or environmental factors (e.g., bee stings, latex).

- **M - Medications**: 
  - Inquire about any medications the patient is currently taking, including prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, and supplements.

- **P - Past Medical History**: 
  - Obtain information on the patient's past medical conditions, surgeries, or chronic illnesses (e.g., asthma, diabetes).

- **L - Last Oral Intake**: 
  - Find out what the patient last ate or drank and when. This is particularly important if the patient needs surgery or has gastrointestinal symptoms.

- **E - Events Leading Up to the Incident**: 
  - Ask about the events or activities that occurred prior to the onset of symptoms or injury to understand possible causes or triggers. 

This acronym helps ensure a thorough and organized collection of patient history.



## Assessing a patient's pain -  OPQRST acronym

Here's a brief explanation of each element in the OPQRST acronym, which is used for assessing a patient's pain:

- **O - Onset**:
  - Ask when the pain started and what the patient was doing when it began. Determine if it was sudden or gradual.

- **P - Provocation/Palliation**:
  - **Provocation**: Find out what makes the pain worse. Ask if certain movements, positions, or activities increase the pain.
  - **Palliation**: Ask what, if anything, makes the pain better (e.g., rest, medication, ice).

- **Q - Quality**:
  - Describe the type of pain the patient is experiencing. Ask if it feels sharp, dull, throbbing, burning, cramping, or another sensation. 

- **R - Radiation**:
  - Determine if the pain stays in one place or spreads to other areas of the body. Ask if it travels or radiates to other locations (e.g., pain starting in the chest and spreading to the arm).

- **S - Severity**:
  - Assess the intensity of the pain. Ask the patient to rate it on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.

- **T - Time**:
  - Find out how long the patient has been experiencing the pain. Ask if it is constant or intermittent and if there have been any changes in intensity or pattern over time.

This structured approach helps in understanding the nature of the pain and guides further diagnosis and treatment.



## Assessing a patient's disability -  AVPU 

Here's a brief explanation of each element in the AVPU acronym, used for quickly assessing a patient's level of consciousness and neurological function:

- **A - Alert**:
  - The patient is fully awake, aware, and responsive. They can respond to questions appropriately and are oriented to their surroundings (knows who they are, where they are, and what time it is).

- **V - Verbal Response**:
  - The patient responds to verbal stimuli but may not be fully awake or oriented. They react when spoken to (e.g., opening their eyes, speaking, or following commands) but may appear confused or disoriented.

- **P - Pain Response**:
  - The patient does not respond to verbal stimuli but reacts to painful stimuli (e.g., pinching, sternal rub). Responses might include movement, groaning, or withdrawal from the painful stimulus.

- **U - Unresponsive**:
  - The patient does not respond to any verbal or painful stimuli. They are unconscious and show no signs of awareness or reaction.

The AVPU scale is a quick and simple tool for assessing a patient's level of consciousness, helping to determine the severity of their condition and guide further action.
